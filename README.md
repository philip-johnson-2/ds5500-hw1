# Homework 1

All code for the assignment is in the source_code folder on github. Each file can be run executed upon opening. The files pull the data needed for each question directly from the GitHub Gapminder repository so no need for changing working directory or downlaoding data.

## Question 1

I received a score of 69% on the GapMinder test. Two of the questions that surprised me the most were the question that asked about percent of the world population with access to electicity as well as the question about vaccination rates. In both cases, I underestimated how high the percentages were. For both statistics, the world is at 80% coverage. This is quite a bit higher than I excpected. 

For the question, I choose to look at the question in the survey that asked about comparing the poverty rate from 20 years ago to today:

"In the last 20 years the proportion of people living in extreme poverty worldwide, has...? "

So I set out to look at historical poverty rates to see try and see how far the world has come at pulling people out of extreme poverty.

First I looked at the extreme poverty rate year over year to look at the trend as a whole.
